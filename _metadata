  "description": "FFS is one of the most legendary mods in the Starbound Workshop.\n\nAdding one of the most detailed and cool weapon mod in the game and working around the limitations that we currently have.\n\nI have decide to patch it to modernize a bit its gameplay. since at times I felt the energy limitation and the long penalties of for switching between guns became too punishing at times.\n\nso what this patch does is:\n\n- Weapons will now use an ammunition counter rather than energy. (UI will be coming soon)\n- You will watch the drawing animation only once.\n- Staged reloads, if you interrupt the reload animation you will return to where you left off.\n- remove movement penalties.\n- Guns will keep track of your ammunion even when you switch between guns.\n\nTo Do\n\n- Patch additional Addons for the mod, while this doesnt break other addons, if the have custom LUA it will use the old system\n- UI that will keep track of the ammunition.\n- Persistance between all weapons. if you equipt the gun in the 2 different slots they will be considers different.\n\n",
