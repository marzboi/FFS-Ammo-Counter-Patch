The operation is failed. We lost Dr.breadnut.
I leave the record of after that.",

"3days later, I was caught by pirates.
I already sent automatic s.o.s message to public frequency, but no one responded.
But I decided not to lose hope.",

"Jesus.
The pirates are working together with USCM researchers.
I don't know what's going to happen.",

"Dr.breadnut's sabotage was failed.
And I have been inserted ruin's parasites in my body.
I can't last long.",

"Unlike researchers who don't know anything, I found that the chief researcher has a connection to cultists.
I have to kill him and escape this place with breadnut tonight.
But, i often loses my mind.. I might be failed.",
