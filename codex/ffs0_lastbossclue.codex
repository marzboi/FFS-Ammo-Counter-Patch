"02.01 Monday.
After the battle, someone keeps whispering ^red;''66.6 seconds''^white; in my ears. 
'Big eye' was quite worried about me, because he is always conscious about spiritual issues, so i don't care about it.",

"02.02 Tuesday.
The number of people complaining of headaches has increased.
Sometimes there were people sympathetic to the cultist, so they were all quarantined.
Everyone is anxious.",

"02.10 Sunday.
Complaining of mental pain from patients were reported.
Among them, people who had seizures were quarantined.",

"02.23 Saturday.
^orange;(The paper is covered with scribbles.)^white;
I released the prisoners who had been quarantined because they seemed to have no problem.
Unless freedom of religion is wrong, it should be recognized.

I imprisoned Papachino, who was instigating the quarantine of normal people, and killed those who tried to rebel.",

"03.04 Monday. 
^orange;(The paper is covered with purple blood.)^white;
